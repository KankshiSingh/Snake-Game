# Snake-Game
Terminal-based Snake game built in C using the ncurses library. It includes real-time movement, countdown timer for berry, increasing speed with score, pause/resume functionality, high score tracking, and instant restart. Game runs in the Linux terminal and demonstrates real-time input handling, collision detection, and dynamic screen rendering.

🐍 Terminal Snake Game (C + ncurses)
This project is a feature-rich terminal-based Snake game developed in C using the ncurses library. The game provides a real-time interactive experience directly inside the terminal, combining classic Snake gameplay with modern enhancements such as a countdown timer, increasing difficulty, pause functionality, and high-score tracking.
The player controls the snake using arrow keys and must collect berries within a limited time. As the score increases, the snake moves faster, making the game progressively more challenging. The project demonstrates key programming concepts including real-time input handling, screen rendering, collision detection, game state management, and timing logic.

✨ Features:
Real-time Snake movement using arrow keys
Countdown timer for each berry (time-based challenge)
Increasing snake speed with higher scores
Pause and resume functionality (P key)
Instant restart after game over (SPACE key)
High score tracking during gameplay session
Colorful terminal UI using ncurses
Customizable game board size using command-line arguments

🛠 Technologies Used:
C Programming Language
ncurses Library (Terminal Graphics & Input Handling)
GCC Compiler
Linux / WSL Environment

🎮 Controls:
Arrow Keys → Move Snake
P → Pause / Resume
SPACE → Restart Game (after Game Over)
ESC → Exit Game

📌 Learning Outcomes:
